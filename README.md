- 👋 Hi, I’m @superg98
- 👀 I’m interested in the design, programming, and circuitry of robotic engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures & Algorithms, Controls Systems, Space Systems, and I'm participating in Undergraduate Research in the Faser Lab at Virginia Tech. I'm also working on a Senior Design project for the NASA/SSAI Vertical Solar Array Technologies that will go up in the Artemis missions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational and circuitry projects involving robotics.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
